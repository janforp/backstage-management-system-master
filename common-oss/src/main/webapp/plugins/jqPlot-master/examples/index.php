There are lots of examples showing basic chart functionality as well as zoom proxies, dynamic replotting, Mekko charts, trend lines, block plots, log axes, filled line (area) plots, and...well you get the picture. When you download a distribution, you'll get over 90 examples of plot types, features and functionality!  The examples are a great way to understand what jqPlot is capable of, and to learn how to use the library.

    <script class="code" type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function(){

        // These two variables should be removed outside of the jqplot.com example environment.
        $.jqplot._noToImageButton = true;
        $.jqplot._noCodeBlock = true;

    });
    </script>
