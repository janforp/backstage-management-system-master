# Contributing Issues

Thank you for considering making jQplot better!

We appreciate the help, especially since we're only a small team of developers who work mainly on their spare time on the project.
All help is appreciated. We welcome bug reports and feature suggestions. If you think you can fix the issue yourself, then go ahead and create the fix and let us know through a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

If you feel like becoming a maintainer of this project, you can reach us through the [dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jqplot-dev) or in the [Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/jqPlot).
